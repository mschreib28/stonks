# Project Organization Rules

## Root Directory Organization

The root of the project should be kept organized with as few loose files as possible. Files should be organized into folders that are appropriate for their content.

### Guidelines

- **Scripts and utilities**: Place data processing scripts, build scripts, and utility scripts in appropriate subdirectories (e.g., `data_processing/`, `utils/`)
- **Configuration files**: Keep essential configuration files (e.g., `pyproject.toml`, `package.json`) in the root, but organize others appropriately
- **Documentation**: Place documentation files in appropriate locations (e.g., `README.md` in root, detailed docs in `docs/` if needed)
- **Entry points**: Keep entry point files in appropriate directories (e.g., `backend/api_server.py` for the API server)

### When adding new files

- Consider if the file belongs in an existing subdirectory
- Create new subdirectories when a logical grouping emerges
- Avoid cluttering the root with multiple similar files (e.g., multiple `build_*.py` scripts should be in `data_processing/` or similar)

### Examples

- ✅ `data_processing/build_event_labels.py` - organized in appropriate folder
- ✅ `utils/ticker_filter.py` - organized in appropriate folder
- ❌ `build_event_labels.py` in root - should be in `data_processing/`
- ❌ Multiple loose utility scripts in root - should be in `utils/` or similar
